"The Moment the Universe Changed 🌌"
10 March 2025, 8:46:07 pm —
The universe didn’t shout, but my world shifted.
In that quiet moment, your name echoed in my soul.
Since then...

Every second is a poem,
Every silence carries your breath,
And every heartbeat? — It knows Manu.

You’re not just a chapter, you’re the whole story —
The calm in my chaos, the smile behind my screen,
The full moon’s envy, and the wish every star failed to grant.

I once searched for peace in books, songs, and skies,
But peace, it turns out, has your eyes.



Tere bina zindagi adhuri si lagti hai 💞
Har pal tu yaad aati hai 💖
Tere saath bitaye har lamhe ko dil mein sajaya hai ❤️
Jitna pyaar tujhe karti hoon, utna khud se bhi nahi kiya 💌



"To the Moon I Said..." 🌙❤
I looked up at the moon last night, full and glowing.
I whispered, “You’re beautiful.”
The moon smiled and said,
“She exists, doesn’t she?”
And in that moment, even the moon felt small.
